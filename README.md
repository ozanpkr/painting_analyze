## Abstract

In recent years, artificial intelligence has created a significant transformation in various fields, including fine arts. Particularly, by combining many artistic techniques with generative networks, AI has enabled the creation of artworks using previously unseen methods. The use of AI in art provides inspiration to artists while offering audiences the opportunity to evaluate artworks from a different perspective. The popularity and development in this field reflect the pursuit of going beyond traditional methods of understanding and interpreting art.

This study explores the use of artificial intelligence as a tool to aid in the analysis and interpretation of art. A dataset of 4005 artworks from famous painters such as Albrecht Dürer, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Vincent Van Gogh was created. An AI-based classification was performed using a convolutional neural network (ESA) model supported by hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, class activation maps (CAM) were used to make the artwork interpretation process more comprehensible.

These visualizations contribute to a deeper understanding of artworks by illustrating AI-based interpretations of art.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and interpretation of artworks using artificial intelligence. Below are the main components used in this project:

- **Dataset:** A dataset consisting of 4005 artworks from artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Vincent Van Gogh.
- **AI Model:** A convolutional neural network (ESA) model was used for classification, supported by hyperparameter optimization.
- **Visualization:** Class activation maps (CAM) were employed to visualize how the model interprets the artworks.

## Methods Used

- **Convolutional Neural Network (ESA):** The deep learning model used for classifying artworks.
- **Class Activation Maps (CAM):** A technique to visualize how the model works on the artworks.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Optimization techniques used to improve the model’s performance.
